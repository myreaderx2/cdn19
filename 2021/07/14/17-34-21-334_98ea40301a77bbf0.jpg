Yep.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday in a public discussion of startups valued at $1 billion or more &#8212; unicorns, in our modern parlance &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/shomikghosh21\">Boldstart Ventures&#8217; Shomik Ghosh<\/a> said something that matched what The Exchange has heard from other investors, albeit in more private conversations.\u00a0The Exchange estimated that the percentage of unicorns with valuations between $1 billion and $2 billion with $100 million in revenue was small. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/shomikghosh21\/status\/1414983568544120833\">Ghosh took note of that approximation and wrote the following<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2177384\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-14-at-9.23.38-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"520\" height=\"193\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-14-at-9.23.38-AM.png 520w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-14-at-9.23.38-AM.png?resize=150,56 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-14-at-9.23.38-AM.png?resize=300,111 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-14-at-9.23.38-AM.png?resize=50,19 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Let me translate: Here the Boldstart investor is saying that it&#8217;s now common to invest in startups at a valuation that works out to 40 to 50 times those companies&#8217; annual recurring revenue, or ARR. LTM stands for <em>last 12 months<\/em>, indicating in a somewhat slang fashion that we&#8217;re not discussing <em>forward<\/em> numbers.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what NTM means: <em>next 12 months<\/em>. Ghosh&#8217;s statement indicates that some startups are actually able to raise capital at even higher multiples of their current revenue, enjoying pricing that can work out to 100 times their ARR for <em>next year<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>This yields some questions. For example, The Wall Street Journal&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mims\/status\/1414976566480752640\">Christopher Mims asked<\/a> if low startup revenues compared to their valuations indicates that there are a great many houses of cards set to fall in time. The answer is maybe, but probably not.

Not even Walmart.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the fellow retail giant announced its latest robotics partnership, teaming with Massachusetts-based automation company Symbotic. The two announced today an extension of their relationship that will bring robotics to 25 regional Walmart distribution centers. The company says the rollout will take &#8220;several years&#8221; to complete.<\/p>\n<p>The deal follows a 2017 pilot that brought Symbotic\u2019s autonomous robotics platform to Walmart\u2019s Brooksville, Florida distribution center in a bid to increase freight sorting, stocking and unloading.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cThe digital transformation happening today, alongside evolving customer habits, is reshaping the retail industry,\u201d Walmart\u2019s Joe Metzger said in a release. \u201cTo serve customers now, and in the future, our business must provide the right tools and training to our associates so they can deliver the items our customers want, when they want them, with unmatched convenience. We\u2019re investing in our supply chain at an unprecedented scale in order to optimize that process end-to-end.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"tQ7nMiNysK\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/02\/walmart-reportedly-ends-contract-with-inventory-robotics-startup-bossa-nova\/\">Walmart reportedly ends contract with inventory robotics startup Bossa Nova<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Walmart reportedly ends contract with inventory robotics startup Bossa Nova&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/02\/walmart-reportedly-ends-contract-with-inventory-robotics-startup-bossa-nova\/embed\/#?secret=tQ7nMiNysK\" data-secret=\"tQ7nMiNysK\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Walmart has been aggressive about piloting robots over the last several years, in hopes of expediting some of its processes. As we\u2019ve noted before, however, its results have, thus far, been uneven. Most notable is the case of Bossa Nova Robotics. The startup was thrown for a loop when Walmart ended its contract with the inventory robotics maker. That\u2019s what pilots are for, of course, but that likely doesn\u2019t dull the sting for the smaller company.<\/p>\n<p>Symbotic has a significantly stronger track record, however. The company lists among its partners one of Walmart\u2019s biggest competitors: Target. And while Walmart could be exploring the possibility of acquiring its own startups (\u00e0 la Amazon, which built its robotics wing atop its acquisition of Kiva Systems), it seems like existing ties could make such a deal a large hurdle.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"XokrWekdj0\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/10\/robotics-roundup-15\/\">When Walmart comes knocking<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;When Walmart comes knocking&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/10\/robotics-roundup-15\/embed\/#?secret=XokrWekdj0\" data-secret=\"XokrWekdj0\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ask anyone who runs a fulfillment\/warehouse robotics company what companies\u2019 top motivation is for embracing automation and they\u2019ll probably cite labor shortages or shipping speeds.

Yes, but the difference seems to be that Windows 365 is far easier to use and involves none of the complexity of setting up a full Azure Virtual Desktop environment in the Azure cloud.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/qKG8r1NERl4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>But couldn&#8217;t Microsoft have made Azure Virtual Desktop easier to use instead of launching yet another virtual desktop service? Yes, but Azure Virtual Desktop is very much an enterprise service and by default, that means it must play nicely with the rest of the complexities of a company&#8217;s existing infrastructure. The pandemic pressed it into service in smaller companies because they had few alternatives, but in many ways, today&#8217;s launch is Microsoft admitting that it was far too difficult to manage for them. Windows 365, on the other hand, is somewhat of a fresh slate. It&#8217;s also available through a basic subscription service.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Microsoft also continues to innovate in Azure Virtual Desktop for those organizations with deep virtualization experience that want more customization and flexibility options,&#8221; the company says. At least we know why the company renamed Windows Virtual Desktop to Azure Virtual desktop now. That would&#8217;ve gotten quite confusing.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2177463\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/monas-cloud-pc.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2177463\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2177463\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/monas-cloud-pc.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"653\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/monas-cloud-pc.jpg 1814w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/monas-cloud-pc.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/monas-cloud-pc.jpg?resize=300,191 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/monas-cloud-pc.jpg?resize=768,489 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/monas-cloud-pc.jpg?resize=680,433 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/monas-cloud-pc.jpg?resize=1536,979 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/monas-cloud-pc.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2177463\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Microsoft<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>This also gives Microsoft the opportunity to talk about &#8220;a new hybrid personal computing category&#8221; its CEO Satya Nadella calls a &#8220;Cloud PC.&#8221; It&#8217;s a bit unclear what exactly that&#8217;s supposed to be, but it&#8217;s a new category.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Just like applications were brought to the cloud with SaaS, we are now bringing the operating system to the cloud, providing organizations with greater flexibility and a secure way to empower their workforce to be more productive and connected, regardless of location,\u201d Nadella explains in today&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/news.microsoft.com\/2021\/07\/14\/microsoft-unveils-windows-365-ushering-in-a-new-category-of-computing\/\">press release<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But isn&#8217;t that just <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forcepoint.com\/cyber-edu\/thin-client\">a thin client<\/a>?

A May 2020 survey of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amp.org\/AMP\/assets\/AMP_SARS-CoV-2_Survey_Report_FINAL.pdf?pass=98\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">118 labs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the US found that 60 percent reported limited swab supplies \u2013 making lack of swabs the most commonly reported supply-chain problem.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One small company that stepped into the fray of swab production was the two year old OPT Industries, a Massachusetts-based company with fifteen employees involved in additive manufacturing (think 3D printing) of dense microfiber structures. The company\u2019s printers and software can print more than just swabs, but the first product the company has focused on since 2020 is the InstaSwab \u2013 a 3D printed swab used in COVID-19 tests.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In four months in 2020, OPT Industries manufactured 800,000 nasal swabs for commercial partners like Kaiser Permanente and medical products distributor Henry Schein. After that trial run, the company foresees an uptick in production capability. Using newer, modular machines, Ou notes that each machine can now produce about 30,000 swabs per day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think the pandemic has given us an opportunity to show a specific medical area where our technology can shine,\u201d Ou tells TechCrunch.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the pandemic is still a global disaster, the vaccines have changed the game when it comes to testing. OPT Industries is betting that it will survive a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/coronavirus.jhu.edu\/testing\/individual-states\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">downturn<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in COVID-19 testing in the US by creating a superior swab, and pivoting to a home-testing market.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pandemic was an early test-run for OPT, which at this point, has raised about $5 million in seed funding. The company is currently not seeking investment, notes founder Jifei Ou, but rather has moved into another testing phase for their swab products, the results of which were released today.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Statistics released today by OPT Industries, the company reports that on average their 3D printed nasal swabs were able to transfer 63 percent of viral genes into detection assays.

Ou\u2019s argument is that with the right type of swab, specifically, one designed with his dense microfiber structures, may help capture more of the virus and help prevent false negatives \u2013 Especially in the early days of infection, when there\u2019s a lower viral load in the body to begin with.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are countless studies looking to estimate the false negative rates for the litany of COVID-19 tests used. Case in point: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0242958#sec018\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one systematic review<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of 34 studies found estimates ranging from a 2 percent false negative rate to a 29 percent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is also evidence linking low viral load to false negatives. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/virologyj.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12985-021-01489-0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> conducted at the Public Health Laboratory in Alberta Canada, analyzed 100,001 COVID-19 tests taken from about 95,000 patients (some patients were tested two or three times). Of that group, the authors were able to confirm five false negative test results.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The false negatives were attributed to low amounts of viral RNA in the body, which the authors note, was a factor of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the samples were collected.

href=\"https:\/\/www.flymachine.com\/\">FlyMachine<\/a> is aiming to seek out the holy grail of the digital music industry, finding a way to capture some of the magic of live concerts and performances in a live-streamed setting. The startup hopes that pandemic era consumer habits around video chat socialization combined with an industry in need of digital diversification can push their flavor of virtual concerts into the lives of music fans.<\/p>\n<p>The startup&#8217;s ambitions aren&#8217;t cheap, FlyMachine tells TechCrunch it has raised $21 million in investor funding to bankroll its plans. The funding has been led by Greycroft Partners and SignalFire, with additional participation from Primary Venture Partners, Contour Venture Partners, Red Sea Ventures, and Silicon Valley Bank.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The virtual concert industry didn&#8217;t have as big of a lockdown moment as some hoped for. Spotify <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/26\/spotify-is-developing-a-virtual-events-feature\/\">experimented<\/a> with virtual events. Meanwhile, startups like Wave<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/10\/wave-opens-the-door-for-musicians-looking-for-a-metaverse-beyond-fortnite\/\"> raised huge bouts of VC funding<\/a> to turn real performers into digital avatars in a bid to create more digital-native concerts. And while some smaller artists embraced shows over Zoom or worked with startups like <a href=\"https:\/\/oda.co\/\">Oda<\/a> who created live concert subscriptions, there were few mainstream hits among bigger acts.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"R1meZuup9Y\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/10\/wave-opens-the-door-for-musicians-looking-for-a-metaverse-beyond-fortnite\/\">Wave opens the door for musicians looking for a &#8216;metaverse&#8217; beyond Fortnite<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Wave opens the door for musicians looking for a &#8216;metaverse&#8217; beyond Fortnite&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/10\/wave-opens-the-door-for-musicians-looking-for-a-metaverse-beyond-fortnite\/embed\/#?secret=R1meZuup9Y\" data-secret=\"R1meZuup9Y\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>To make FlyMachine&#8217;s brand of virtual concerts <em>a thing<\/em>, the startup isn&#8217;t trying to convert potential in-person attendees of a show into virtual participants, instead hoping to create an attractive experience for the folks who would normally have to skip the show. Whether those virtual attendees were too far from a venue, couldn&#8217;t get a babysitter for the night, or just aren&#8217;t jazzed about a mosh pit scene anymore, FlyMachine is hoping there are enough potential attendees on the bubble to sustain the startup as they try to blur the lines between &#8220;a night in and a night out,&#8221; CEO Andrew Dreskin says.<\/p>\n<p>The startup&#8217;s strategy centers on building up partnerships with name brand concert venues around the US &#8212;\u00a0Bowery Ballroom in <span class=\"xn-location\">New York City<\/span>, Bimbo&#8217;s 365 Club in\u00a0<span class=\"xn-location\">San Francisco<\/span>, The Crocodile in\u00a0<span class=\"xn-location\">Seattle<\/span>, Marathon Music Works in\u00a0<span class=\"xn-location\">Nashville <\/span>and Teragram Ballroom in <span class=\"xn-location\">Los Angeles, among them &#8212; and live-streaming some of the shows at those venues to at-home audiences.

policymakers and innovators to drive economic opportunity through expanding equity ownership and private market liquidity.\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\">The increasing regulation of ESG (environmental, social, governance) disclosure reporting may have started in the public markets, but will almost certainly have downstream effects for private market actors \u2014 for founders, companies and investors.<\/p>\n<p>Since his confirmation as the chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in April, Gary Gensler has made reforming ESG disclosures concerning climate change risk and human capital a top priority. The SEC\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/press-release\/2021-99\">regulatory agenda<\/a> confirms as much. And Gensler is not alone in his focus on ESG at the federal level.<\/p>\n<p>President Joe Biden <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefing-room\/presidential-actions\/2021\/05\/20\/executive-order-on-climate-related-financial-risk\/\">issued an executive order<\/a> encouraging regulators to assess climate-related financial risk. At the end of March, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/secyellen\/status\/1395520116339662848\">Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wrote on Twitter<\/a> that \u201cour future livelihoods \u2026 depend on the financial sector to build a more sustainable and resilient economy.\u201d Congress is considering measures that would require increased ESG disclosures, including the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/117th-congress\/house-bill\/1277?s=1&amp;r=2\">Improving Corporate Governance Through Diversity Act<\/a>, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/117th-congress\/house-bill\/2123\">Diversity and Inclusion Data Accountability and Transparency Act<\/a>\u00a0and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/117th-congress\/house-bill\/2570\">Climate Risk Disclosure Act<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>This renewed federal focus on ESG issues will bolster the SEC\u2019s effort to create disclosure practices for public companies and mutual funds. Regardless of whether these federal policies around ESG come to pass, they reflect a momentum that will almost certainly impact private markets:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firms that want to go public \u2014 whether via SPAC, direct listing or traditional IPO \u2014 may have to seriously consider board diversity or environmental reporting in conjunction with \u2014 or well in advance of \u2014 their debuts.<\/li>\n<li>Private companies seeking to align with public companies as vendors or partners may be expected to meet specific ESG requirements before the engagement.<\/li>\n<li>Startup founders and venture funds raising capital may work to maintain the largest target market by proactively scoping ESG engagements to ensure they meet criteria for investors who may have their own ESG-focused investment requirements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In his confirmation hearing before the Senate in early March, Gensler said, \u201cMarkets \u2014 and technology \u2014 are always changing. Our rules have to change along with them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tThe federal government is moving to increase regulation around ESG disclosure requirements with the goals of establishing greater transparency and metrics for public companies.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>The federal government is moving to increase regulation around ESG disclosure requirements with the goals of establishing greater transparency and metrics for public companies. These requirements are a response to the changing markets \u2014 demands from consumers, scrutiny from investors and a general insistence for higher corporate standards from society at large.<\/p>\n<p>Private markets aren\u2019t immune to these forces. Already, three-quarters of investors in a <a href=\"https:\/\/files.pitchbook.com\/website\/files\/pdf\/PitchBook_2020_Sustainable_Investment_Survey.pdf\">2020 survey<\/a> said it was very important to measure the success of sustainability initiatives, but they also said there\u2019s been a lack of clarity on how to define and measure outcomes.<\/p>\n<p>To be sure, private markets are not headed toward full-scale adoption of ESG regulations. They will not be subject to the same reporting or disclosures framework as their public counterparts. Not today, and possibly not for some time.<\/p>\n<p>But we may begin to see private investors, funds and companies adapting to get ahead of ESG regulation and position themselves to effectively operate in a new \u2014 albeit adjacent \u2014 regulatory environment. In their case, the rules may not change \u2014 but the game could.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"lzpPXXZY84\"><p><a

This includes plans to build a massive cathode plant in the South Korean city of Gumi, that will increase the industrial giant\u2019s anode production capacity by seven-fold, from 40,000 tons to around 260,000 tons by 2026.

The goal is to improve situational awareness and increase the effectiveness of firefighters, all while minimizing potential injuries and casualties.<\/p>\n<p>The company, which was founded in 2015, just <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/0001871374\/000187137421000001\/xslFormDX01\/primary_doc.xml\">raised about $5.5 million in financing this week<\/a>. The company\u2019s CEO, Sam Cossman, declined to name the lead investor, citing a confidentiality clause in the term sheet. He characterized the strategic investor as a publicly-traded company, and Qwake is the first startup investment this company has made.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>(Normally, I\u2019d <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/14\/your-funding-round-isnt-special-but-you-might-be\/\">ignore fundings without these sorts of details<\/a>, but given that I am <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/01\/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world\/\">obsessed with DisasterTech<\/a> these days, why the hell not).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"EYKZFvPUl2\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/02\/data-was-the-new-oil-until-the-oil-caught-fire\/\">Data was the new oil, until the oil caught fire<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Data was the new oil, until the oil caught fire&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/02\/data-was-the-new-oil-until-the-oil-caught-fire\/embed\/#?secret=EYKZFvPUl2\" data-secret=\"EYKZFvPUl2\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Qwake has had success in recent months with netting large government contracts as it approaches a wider release of its product in late-2021. It <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/charliefink\/2020\/12\/02\/qwake-technologies-funded-to-fight-fires-with-ar-tech\/\">secured a $1.4 million contract from the Department of Homeland Security<\/a> last year, and also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/qwake-technologies-awarded-air-force-contract-to-adapt-ar-solution-for-smokejumpers-and-special-operations-301260333.html\">secured a partnership with the U.S. Air Force along with RSA in April<\/a>. In addition, it raised a bit of angel funding and participated in Verizon\u2019s 5G First Responder Lab as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.5gfirstresponderlab.com\/cohort1\/\">part of its inaugural cohort<\/a> (reminder that TechCrunch is <i>still<\/i> owned by Verizon).<\/p>\n<p>Cossman, who founded Qwake along with John Long, Mike Ralston, and Omer Haciomeroglu, has long been interested in fires, and specifically, volcanos. For years, he has been an expeditionary videographer and innovator who climbed calderas and attempted to bridge the gap between audiences, humanitarian response, and science.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of the work that I have done up until this point was focused on earth science and volcanoes,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of projects were focused on predicting volcanic eruptions and looking at using sensor networks and different things of that nature to make people who live in those regions that are exposed to volcanic threats safer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>During one project in Nicaragua, his team suddenly found itself lost amidst the smoke of an active volcano. There were \u201cthick, dense superheated volcanic gases that prevented us from navigating correctly,\u201d Cossman said. He wanted to find technology that might help them navigate in those conditions in the future, so he explored the products available to firefighters. \u201cWe figured, \u2018Surely these men and women have figured out how do you see in austere environments, how do you make quick decisions, etc.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He was left disappointed, but also with a new vision: to build such technology himself. And thus, Qwake was born. \u201cI was pissed off that the men and women who arguably need this stuff more than anybody \u2014 certainly more than a consumer \u2014 didn&#8217;t have anywhere to get it, and yet it was entirely possible,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was only being talked about in science fiction, so I&#8217;ve dedicated the last six years or so to make this thing real.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Building such a product required a diverse set of talent, including hardware engineering, neuroscience, firefighting, product design and more. \u201cWe started tinkering and building this prototype. And it very interestingly got the attention of the firefighting community,\u201d Cossman said.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2177521\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2177521\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2177521\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/049A7843_HiRes_copyright.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"524\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/049A7843_HiRes_copyright.jpg 6612w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/049A7843_HiRes_copyright.jpg?resize=150,116 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/049A7843_HiRes_copyright.jpg?resize=300,231 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/049A7843_HiRes_copyright.jpg?resize=768,592 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/049A7843_HiRes_copyright.jpg?resize=680,524 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/049A7843_HiRes_copyright.jpg?resize=1536,1184 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/049A7843_HiRes_copyright.jpg?resize=2048,1578 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/049A7843_HiRes_copyright.jpg?resize=50,39 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2177521\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Qwake offers a helmet-based IoT product that firefighters wear to collect data from environments. <strong>Image Credits<\/strong>: Qwake Technologies<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Qwake at the time didn\u2019t know any firefighters, and as the founders did customer calls, they learned that sensors and cameras weren\u2019t really what responders needed. Instead, they wanted more operational clarity: not just more data inputs, but systems that can take all that noise, synthesize it, and relay critical information to them about exactly what\u2019s going on in an environment and what the next steps should be.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, Qwake built a full solution, including both an IoT device that attaches to a firefighter\u2019s helmet and also a tablet-based application that processes the sensor data coming in and attempts to synchronize information from all teams simultaneously. The cloud ties it all together.<\/p>\n<p>So far, the company has design customers with the fire departments of Menlo Park, California and Boston. With the new funding, the team is looking to advance the state of its prototype and get it ready for wider distribution by readying it for scalable manufacturing as it approaches a more public launch later this year.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"vgfZQyLROS\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/08\/when-the-earth-is-gone-at-least-the-internet-will-still-be-working\/\">When the Earth is gone, at least the internet will still be working<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;When the Earth is gone, at least the internet will still be working&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/08\/when-the-earth-is-gone-at-least-the-internet-will-still-be-working\/embed\/#?secret=vgfZQyLROS\" data-secret=\"vgfZQyLROS\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to tough environments to build new technology, firefighting has to be among the most difficult.

co-founder and<\/span> CEO Rahul Vohra joined us last week at TechCrunch Early Stage to provide an in-depth look at how he and his company worked to optimize and refine their product early to create a version of &#8220;growth hacking&#8221; that would not only help Superhuman attract users, but serve them best and retain them, too. Vohra articulated a system that other entrepreneurs should be able to apply to their own businesses, regardless of area or focus.<\/p>\n<h2>The only good hack isn&#8217;t a hack at all<\/h2>\n<p>Vohra started off by explaining that he&#8217;s happy to discuss anything relating to the early stages of startup growth (and welcomed <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rahulvohra?lang=en\">DMs to his Twitter<\/a> if you have any specific questions). He identified a number of key areas of concern early on in company-building, including growth, pricing and even traditional growth hacking, but he noted that one area of focus is more important than any other:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">The<\/span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">most<\/span> <span

but Vohra backs up this assertion with endorsements from startup industry heavyweights like Paul Graham, Sam Altman and Marc Andreessen underlying the key importance of product-market fit &#8212; and

Also, he points out that it can be easy to mistake the &#8220;feeling&#8221; of having good product-market fit as a leading indicator, when in fact it&#8217;s usually a lagging one.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Superhuman worked to optimize and refine their product early to create a version of &#8220;growth hacking&#8221; that would not only help the company attract users, but serve them best and retain them, too.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5302483,"featured_media":2128559,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"40983b42-0439-3df0-99b8-bb522715f139"},"categories":[426985170,20429,17396],"tags":[576846618,576900038,576860863,576707652,449557042,45188],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796352],"tc_event":[576831931],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/early-stage-Rahul-Vohra.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2UaT0GH","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.23,"featured":false,"subtitle":"","seoTitle":"","editorialContentProvider":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":2080808,"authors":[5302483],"hide_featured_image":false,"canonical_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/14\/superhumans-rahul-vohra-explains-how-to-optimize-your-startups-products-for-lasting-growth\/","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2176911"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2176911"}],"version-history":[{"count":11,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2176911\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2177545,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2176911\/revisions\/2177545"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/5302483"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2176911&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/5302483"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2128559"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2176911"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2176911"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2176911"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2176911"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2176911"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2176911"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2176911"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":5302483,"name":"Darrell Etherington","url":"","description":"Writer covering space, science and health tech.

workspace space targeting distributed teams, has attracted thousands of users and millions of dollars in venture capital.

Like nearly every other person unexpectedly flung into the world of remote work, the trio experienced Zoom fatigue through school and classes.

The initial use case for Nooks looked like office hours, and homework parties, says Lee. Since initially piloting in schools, Nooks has grown to focus more on helping distributed teams work, but the ethos has stayed consistent.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere should be this persistent space where, instead of just being in an ephemeral space like a meeting, you can go somewhere to create more spontaneous connections,&#8221; Lee said.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Nooks&#8217; hooks<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>When a user enters Nooks, they are greeted by a Slack-like interface. Instead of a panel of channels on the left, though, employees are invited to enter \u201cspaces.\u201d Each space can vary in purpose, from a front-desk mock-up to a beach hangout or a design huddle. Nooks has a space dedicated to bashing bugs that show up in code. Upon first entry into the platform, the Nooks UX stood out as different from some of its competitors. While companies like Branch and Gather look like video games with a productivity element, Nooks skips the avatar feel altogether, looking closer to<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/06\/teamflow-lands-3-9-million-for-a-productive-virtual-hq-platform\/\"> Teamflow<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/20\/tandem\/\">Tandem.<\/a> The company uses a video API to let each person take up little orbs of space, and adds integrations of platforms like Google Docs, YouTube, Asana or GitHub.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2177433\" style=\"width: 796px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2177433\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-2177433\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Main_office.png\" alt=\"nooks-main-screen\" width=\"786\" height=\"491\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Main_office.png 1440w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Main_office.png?resize=150,94 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Main_office.png?resize=300,188 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Main_office.png?resize=768,480 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Main_office.png?resize=680,425 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Main_office.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2177433\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Nooks<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Co-founder Suri said that the company decided to go for a simpler aesthetic to promote conversation, not more clicking.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t actually believe that in order to talk to someone you need to be a video gamer, have your avatar around and go walk up to them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be as simple as seeing them in a room, and entering that room.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2177432\" style=\"width: 773px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2177432\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2177432\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Beach_Hangout.png\" alt=\"nooks-social-space\" width=\"763\" height=\"477\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Beach_Hangout.png 2880w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Beach_Hangout.png?resize=150,94 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Beach_Hangout.png?resize=300,188 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Beach_Hangout.png?resize=768,480 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Beach_Hangout.png?resize=680,425 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Beach_Hangout.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Beach_Hangout.png?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Beach_Hangout.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2177432\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Nooks<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Of course, the company is working to balance that simplicity with an engaging environment, and includes customization of spaces and background music.

Not to mention that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/30\/slacks-new-video-and-voice-tools-are-nod-to-changing-face-of-work\/\">Slack is releasing a series of communication<\/a> tools around spontaneity and live communication.<\/p>\n<p>Still, Nooks currently has thousands of weekly active users from teams and organizations like Stanford, Embroker and Workato. Teams using Nooks spend an average of six hours a day on the platform, the company said.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"vWpYTYRzZS\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/22\/do-we-need-so-many-virtual-hq-platforms\/\">Do we need so many virtual HQ platforms?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Do we need so many virtual HQ platforms?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/22\/do-we-need-so-many-virtual-hq-platforms\/embed\/#?secret=vWpYTYRzZS\" data-secret=\"vWpYTYRzZS\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2><strong>Hybrid work\u2019s virtual growing pains <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As the pandemic fades in parts of the world, startups like Nooks will need to figure out ways to adapt to the return of hybrid teams after a long stint of mostly remote work. The new challenge for these startups is how they position themselves to embed well into the new culture of work.<\/p>\n<p>And <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocol.com\/workplace\/proximity-bias-hybrid-work\">proximity bias might make that hard to do.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Proximity bias is the idea that employees who go in-person are valued higher than employees who work virtually. It\u2019s one of the realities that make hybrid work so hard to pull off at scale: Equity suffers when a group of employees is positioned as more important or prized only because they can travel to an office.<\/p>\n<p>Virtual workspace startups, especially the ones that want to bring work culture online, could accidentally overly fragment those who work from home versus those who work in-person. The fragmentation will disproportionately impact historically overlooked individuals, which include minorities and women. Notably, of the virtual HQs out there, most have been built, run and funded by men.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"v1e05bWxvs\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/28\/3-views-on-the-future-of-meetings\/\">3 views on the future of meetings<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;3 views on the future of meetings&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/28\/3-views-on-the-future-of-meetings\/embed\/#?secret=v1e05bWxvs\" data-secret=\"v1e05bWxvs\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>When asked about how they are combating proximity bias, Lee said that \u201cmore frequent, fluid and casual conversation with remote employees helps them build stronger bonds with the rest of the team.\u201d Sure enough, there\u2019s an argument that many virtual HQ startups launched to extinguish proximity bias by bringing everyone in an office to the same digital world.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, equalizing the playing field will require aggressive intention. How can a startup make sure virtual HQ employees have access to a spontaneous, in-person stand-up in Conference Room A? How does a platform give any employee, regardless of location, the chance to give input, disagree or share post-meeting banter? Can avatars, or floating video orbs, start to give subtle physical cues beyond a clap or thumbs up?<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d wager that these features are the moonshot, and survival hack, for virtual HQ startups long-term.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After operating in beta for a year, Nooks, a virtual workspace space targeting distributed teams, has attracted thousands of users and millions of dollars in venture capital.

The same dataset indicates that Series B, C, D and E rounds also reached new highs in 2021 compared to years going back to at least 2015.<\/p>\n<p>So startups are getting larger checks, earlier. Does that mean that many startups are landing investments with smaller revenues than their stage (or capital base) would normally require? Yep.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday in a public discussion of startups valued at $1 billion or more &#8212; unicorns, in our modern parlance &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/shomikghosh21\">Boldstart Ventures&#8217; Shomik Ghosh<\/a> said something that matched what The Exchange has heard from other investors, albeit in more private conversations.\u00a0The Exchange estimated that the percentage of unicorns with valuations between $1 billion and $2 billion with $100 million in revenue was small. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/shomikghosh21\/status\/1414983568544120833\">Ghosh took note of that approximation and wrote the following<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2177384\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-14-at-9.23.38-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"520\" height=\"193\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-14-at-9.23.38-AM.png 520w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-14-at-9.23.38-AM.png?resize=150,56 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-14-at-9.23.38-AM.png?resize=300,111 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-14-at-9.23.38-AM.png?resize=50,19 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Let me translate: Here the Boldstart investor is saying that it&#8217;s now common to invest in startups at a valuation that works out to 40 to 50 times those companies&#8217; annual recurring revenue, or ARR. LTM stands for <em>last 12 months<\/em>, indicating in a somewhat slang fashion that we&#8217;re not discussing <em>forward<\/em> numbers.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what NTM means: <em>next 12 months<\/em>. Ghosh&#8217;s statement indicates that some startups are actually able to raise capital at even higher multiples of their current revenue, enjoying pricing that can work out to 100 times their ARR for <em>next year<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>This yields some questions. For example, The Wall Street Journal&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mims\/status\/1414976566480752640\">Christopher Mims asked<\/a> if low startup revenues compared to their valuations indicates that there are a great many houses of cards set to fall in time.

A May 2020 survey of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amp.org\/AMP\/assets\/AMP_SARS-CoV-2_Survey_Report_FINAL.pdf?pass=98\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">118 labs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the US found that 60 percent reported limited swab supplies \u2013 making lack of swabs the most commonly reported supply-chain problem.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One small company that stepped into the fray of swab production was the two year old OPT Industries, a Massachusetts-based company with fifteen employees involved in additive manufacturing (think 3D printing) of dense microfiber structures. The company\u2019s printers and software can print more than just swabs, but the first product the company has focused on since 2020 is the InstaSwab \u2013 a 3D printed swab used in COVID-19 tests.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In four months in 2020, OPT Industries manufactured 800,000 nasal swabs for commercial partners like Kaiser Permanente and medical products distributor Henry Schein. After that trial run, the company foresees an uptick in production capability. Using newer, modular machines, Ou notes that each machine can now produce about 30,000 swabs per day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think the pandemic has given us an opportunity to show a specific medical area where our technology can shine,\u201d Ou tells TechCrunch.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the pandemic is still a global disaster, the vaccines have changed the game when it comes to testing.

Ou\u2019s argument is that with the right type of swab, specifically, one designed with his dense microfiber structures, may help capture more of the virus and help prevent false negatives \u2013 Especially in the early days of infection, when there\u2019s a lower viral load in the body to begin with.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are countless studies looking to estimate the false negative rates for the litany of COVID-19 tests used.

Of that group, the authors were able to confirm five false negative test results.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The false negatives were attributed to low amounts of viral RNA in the body, which the authors note, was a factor of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the samples were collected.

known for its tools that help developers build text message\/phone call-powered apps, is branching out into a new category: live streaming.<\/p>\n<p>This morning the company announced<a href=\"https:\/\/www.twilio.com\/live\"> Twilio Live<\/a>, a platform meant to help developers more easily integrate live video\/audio features into their apps.<\/p>\n<p>Details are still a bit light, but here&#8217;s what we know so far:<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li>Twilio Live is launching today but in invite-only Beta mode \u2014 so not everyone will get access immediately.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;ll support iOS, Android, and all &#8220;major browsers&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>In addition to the content streaming tools, Twilio is also building out interactivity features to support things like text chat, audience polling, screen sharing, and bringing audience members up as speakers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We saw a massive rush of Clubhouse clones hit the market after that app&#8217;s spike in popularity, with even huge names like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/30\/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too\/\">LinkedIn<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/02\/twitter-spaces-arrives-on-android-ahead-of-clubhouse\/\">Twitter<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/31\/discord-stage-channels-voice-events\/\">Discord<\/a> rushing to replicate its best features. With Twilio effectively turning that feature set into a plug-and-play SDK here, I&#8217;d expect to see a lot more of that.<\/p>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges of reinventing the wheel when it comes to live streaming is one of scaling; what might work beautifully for one hundred viewers could grind to a halt when you have that viral moment that brings a sudden influx of ten thousand. Twilio has spent the last decade figuring out infrastructure scaling and latency \u2014 chances are, they&#8217;re starting on pretty good footing here.<\/p>\n<p>No details seem to be available currently as to how Twilio Live&#8217;s pricing will work.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"H9MIBwlJkS\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/06\/twilio-ceo-jeff-lawson-on-shifting-a-3000-person-company-to-fully-remote\/\">Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson on shifting a 3,000-person company to fully remote<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson on shifting a 3,000-person company to fully remote&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/06\/twilio-ceo-jeff-lawson-on-shifting-a-3000-person-company-to-fully-remote\/embed\/#?secret=H9MIBwlJkS\" data-secret=\"H9MIBwlJkS\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Twilio, a company best known for its tools that help developers build text message\/phone call-powered apps, is branching out into a new category: live streaming.

Though the US Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 7 percent increase in need for radiologists by 2029 as the population grows older, The Association of American Medical Colleges predicts the country will experience a shortfall of specialists \u2013\u00a0a group which includes radiologists.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"CkgajMHuVy\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/04\/17\/aidoc-b\/\">Aidoc, the AI solution for medical imaging analysis, raises $27M Series B<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Aidoc, the AI solution for medical imaging analysis, raises $27M Series B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/04\/17\/aidoc-b\/embed\/#?secret=CkgajMHuVy\" data-secret=\"CkgajMHuVy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That shortfall <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aamc.org\/news-insights\/press-releases\/new-aamc-report-confirms-growing-physician-shortage\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">could range from 17,100 to 41,900<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (these numbers include radiologists among other specialities, but the report doesn\u2019t break down exactly how many radiologists are included in that count).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UK, however, is already struggling with a radiologist shortage that ranges from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rcr.ac.uk\/posts\/new-reports-put-uk-radiologist-shortages-focus\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">27 to 37 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, depending on location.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI has been proposed as one solution to the widening radiologist shortage \u2013\u00a0per the American Medical Association\u2019s report: \u201cadvances in artificial intelligence could improve the productivity of radiologists, pathologists, and others,\u201d <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aamc.org\/media\/45976\/download\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it notes.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s only a partial solution. Though we might be able to make each individual radiologist more productive with A.I., even Walach notes that A.I software can\u2019t really diagnose a patient all on its own.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cDefinitely a radiologist needs to confirm the findings,\u201d he notes.\u00a0 \u201cThat the AI solution doesn&#8217;t do anything without the radiologist.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point, the pitch for AI in the world of radiology is that it\u2019s a tool, not a replacement for a trained radiologist. And there\u2019s been a lot of academic work done to develop these AI tools:\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were an estimated 596 papers on the topic in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41746-020-00324-0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2010 and 12,422 by 2019<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this, AI has yet to truly become a go-to for radiologists. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.jacr.org\/article\/S1546-1440(21)00293-3\/fulltext\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A 2020 survey<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> done by American College of Radiology found that just 30 percent of radiologists were using A.I in their practices \u2013\u00a0the authors called the penetration of the technology \u201cmoderate.\u201d Only 20 percent of those not using A.I said they had plans to purchase it in the next one to five years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We may be poised to see a bit of an uptick in the use of A.I. in clinics or hospitals post-coronavirus. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.technologyreview.com\/2020\/04\/23\/1000410\/ai-triage-covid-19-patients-health-care\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some hospitals<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> turned to A.I facing shortages of staff and high patient loads.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, Walach says that it wasn\u2019t a major boon to Aidoc.\u00a0If anything he says it slowed the company\u2019s growth (though it was still trending upwards anyway \u2013 Walach estimates the company increased contracted annual recurring revenue seven-fold between Q1 of 2020 and Q1 2021).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, he attributes the growth to a wave of research on A.I\u2019s impact on patient welfare beyond initial diagnosis. He points to studies that have found <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gastrojournal.org\/article\/S0016-5085(19)41342-5\/fulltext\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.I can reduce length of hospital stays by identifying which patients to send home<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think the biggest trends in this market is that one more and more evidence is starting to come up that AI has significant downstream benefits,\u201d Walach says.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite barriers to widespread adoption of AI, Aidoc has a long list of commercial partners. The company has almost 600 partnerships with hospitals and clinics including <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Radiology Partners, Yale New Haven Medical Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UMass, University of Rochester Medical Center, LucidHealth, 4ways Healthcare, Telemedicine Clinic, Grupo Fleury, University Hospital of Basel, Sheba Medical Center, Hadassah Medical Center, and Global Diagnostics Australia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the company projects that it will be used in 10 percent of US hospitals within two years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To some extent, Bischoff argues that the adoption of Aidoc at other high profile health centers could help drive this growth. That could perhaps signal that the company may overcome the slower-than-expected leak of A.I from lab to clinic.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThat ability to drive high levels of trust \u2013 that would allow that deeper integration,\u201d he says. \u201cThere&#8217;s a little bit of a lighthouse type dynamic in healthcare where if the leaders do certain things others follow.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aidoc is headquartered in New York, with a research branch in Israel and has about 200\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">employees. With this new round of funding, the company plans to invest heavily into R&amp;D and has plans to double the amount of conditions evaluated by the company\u2019s algorithms.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"HcqZDDI1nC\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/30\/9-berlin-based-vcs-discuss-how-covid-19-has-changed-their-strategy\/\">10 Berlin-based VCs discuss how COVID-19 has changed the landscape<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;10 Berlin-based VCs discuss how COVID-19 has changed the landscape&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/30\/9-berlin-based-vcs-discuss-how-covid-19-has-changed-their-strategy\/embed\/#?secret=HcqZDDI1nC\" data-secret=\"HcqZDDI1nC\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Aidoc, an artificial intelligence company that develops triage and analysis software, is about to double its funding.

It&#8217;ll be available for business users (and only business users) on August 2, 2021.<\/p>\n<p>Announced through a somewhat inscrutable press release, Windows 365 has been long expected and is really just an evolution of existing remote desktop services.<\/p>\n<p>But hey, you may say, doesn&#8217;t Microsoft already offer <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/07\/microsofts-windows-virtual-desktop-is-now-azure-virtual-desktop\/\">Azure Virtual Desktop<\/a> that gives businesses the option to let their employees access a Windows PC in the cloud? Yes, but the difference seems to be that Windows 365 is far easier to use and involves none of the complexity of setting up a full Azure Virtual Desktop environment in the Azure cloud.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/qKG8r1NERl4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>But couldn&#8217;t Microsoft have made Azure Virtual Desktop easier to use instead of launching yet another virtual desktop service? Yes, but Azure Virtual Desktop is very much an enterprise service and by default, that means it must play nicely with the rest of the complexities of a company&#8217;s existing infrastructure. The pandemic pressed it into service in smaller companies because they had few alternatives, but in many ways, today&#8217;s launch is Microsoft admitting that it was far too difficult to manage for them. Windows 365, on the other hand, is somewhat of a fresh slate. It&#8217;s also available through a basic subscription service.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Microsoft also continues to innovate in Azure Virtual Desktop for those organizations with deep virtualization experience that want more customization and flexibility options,&#8221; the company says. At least we know why the company renamed Windows Virtual Desktop to Azure Virtual desktop now. That would&#8217;ve gotten quite confusing.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2177463\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/monas-cloud-pc.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2177463\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2177463\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/monas-cloud-pc.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"653\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/monas-cloud-pc.jpg 1814w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/monas-cloud-pc.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/monas-cloud-pc.jpg?resize=300,191 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/monas-cloud-pc.jpg?resize=768,489 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/monas-cloud-pc.jpg?resize=680,433 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/monas-cloud-pc.jpg?resize=1536,979 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/monas-cloud-pc.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2177463\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Microsoft<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>This also gives Microsoft the opportunity to talk about &#8220;a new hybrid personal computing category&#8221; its CEO Satya Nadella calls a &#8220;Cloud PC.&#8221; It&#8217;s a bit unclear what exactly that&#8217;s supposed to be, but it&#8217;s a new category.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Just like applications were brought to the cloud with SaaS, we are now bringing the operating system to the cloud, providing organizations with greater flexibility and a secure way to empower their workforce to be more productive and connected, regardless of location,\u201d Nadella explains in today&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/news.microsoft.com\/2021\/07\/14\/microsoft-unveils-windows-365-ushering-in-a-new-category-of-computing\/\">press release<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But isn&#8217;t that just <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forcepoint.com\/cyber-edu\/thin-client\">a thin client<\/a>?

inevitably develop, which engineers have to scramble to fix. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mobile.dev\/\">Mobile.dev<\/a>, a new startup from a former Uber engineer, wants to flip that story and catch errors before the app launches. Today, the company emerged from stealth with a beta of their solution and a $3 million seed investment led by Cowboy Ventures with participation from multiple tech luminaries.<\/p>\n<p>While he was at Uber, company CEO and co-founder Leland Takamine says that he observed this workflow where an app was put out in the world, a company set up tooling to monitor the app and then worked to fix the problem as users reported issues or the monitoring software picked them up. At Uber, they began building tooling to try to catch problems pre-production.<\/p>\n<p>When he started mobile.dev with COO Jacob Krupski, the goal was to build something like this, but for every company regardless of the size. &#8220;The insight that we had was that anything we could do to catch problems before releasing an app was 100 times more valuable than anything that you can monitor in production,&#8221; Takamine told me.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>And that&#8217;s what the company aims to do.&#8221;Our mission at mobile.dev at a high level is to empower companies to deliver high quality mobile applications. And more specifically, stop sacrificing users and start catching issues before you release,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"LrSpe4qARl\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/26\/ex-uber-team-raises-6m-seed-for-geospatial-analytics-platform-unfolded-ai\/\">Ex-Uber team raises $6M seed for geospatial analytics platform Unfolded.ai<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Ex-Uber team raises $6M seed for geospatial analytics platform Unfolded.ai&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/26\/ex-uber-team-raises-6m-seed-for-geospatial-analytics-platform-unfolded-ai\/embed\/#?secret=LrSpe4qARl\" data-secret=\"LrSpe4qARl\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>He says that when he speaks to app developers about a solution like this, they are intrigued because as he says &#8220;it&#8217;s really a no-brainer&#8221; question, but unless you have the scale of a company like Uber and vast engineering resources there hasn&#8217;t been a solution like this available for the average company or individual developer. And it was that deep technical expertise he built at Uber that laid the groundwork for what they are building at mobile.dev.<\/p>\n<p>The two founders launched the company a year ago and have been working with design partners and initial customers, particularly Reddit. The product goes into beta today. For now, they are the only two employees, but that is going to change with the new capital as they look to add more engineering talent.<\/p>\n<p>With a very specific set of skills required to build a solution like this, it makes it even more challenging to hire diverse employees, but Takamine says that the goal is to build a diverse team. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s making sure that we look beyond just our immediate network and making sure that we&#8217;re looking at diverse sources,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>The company launched during the pandemic and with just the two founders involved have been fully remote up until now, and they intend to keep it that way as they add new employees in the coming months.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to be fully remote, I think we have a great advantage that we&#8217;re starting from remote, and it&#8217;s much more difficult to transition from an office to remote.

In American culture, professionals are expected to promote their abilities and accomplishments or personal branding. While that practice is accepted in the United States, it\u2019s frowned upon in many other countries, where modesty is more culturally valued.<\/p>\n<p>That means many international professionals and students \u2014 perhaps even you \u2014 may feel out of their comfort zone when submitting an application for an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alcorn.law\/eb-1a-green-card\/\">EB-1A extraordinary ability green card<\/a> and gathering the five to eight recommendation letters from individuals who are qualified to assess their work and achievements.<\/p>\n<p>Before I dive in further, I suggest you consult an experienced immigration attorney who can assess whether you would be a strong candidate for an EB-1A or if other options would better suit your situation and goals. You should consider talking to your employer about sponsoring you for a green card, and know that you can also file a petition on your own. The EB-1A and EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) are two employment-based green cards for which the beneficiaries can self-petition (without an employer sponsor).<\/p>\n<h2>Qualifications for an EB-1A<\/h2>\n<p>To qualify for an EB-1A, you must meet any <em>three <\/em>of the following:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>You have received nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence.

raises $32M for its intranet platform"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.simpplr.com\/\">Simpplr<\/a>, a modern platform for building intranet sites (or &#8217;employee communications and enablement platforms,&#8217; as the company calls it), today announced that it has raised a $32 million Series C round led by Tola Capital. Norwest Ventures, which led the company&#8217;s Series B round last year, as well as Salesforce Ventures and George Still Ventures also participated. This brings Simpplr&#8217;s total funding to just over $61 million.<\/p>\n<p>As Simpplr CEO and founder Dhiraj Sharma told me, the Series B round was meant to help the team accelerate product innovation and development. Unsurprisingly, the COVID-19 pandemic only increased demand for digital workplace solutions like Simpplr. As Sharma noted, the company&#8217;s thesis was always that the world was moving toward remote\/hybrid work. The pandemic only accelerated this process and with that, the sense of urgency in its customer base to modernize their own platforms for communicating with their employees. To keep up with this growth, the company doubled its team since last August (though Sharma, just like many other startup founders I&#8217;ve recently talked to, also bemoaned that it\u2019s becoming increasingly hard to find talent).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/simpplr.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2177267\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/simpplr.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" \/><\/a><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The company says that it added 100 enterprise customers over the course of the last year. Today, its customer base includes a number of early adopters like Splunk or Nutanix, which were always building toward a global workforce and always had a need for a product like Simpplr. But due to the pandemic, more traditional businesses like Fox, AAA insurance or Renewal by Andersen also needed to quickly find ways to support their newly remote workforces.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When this pandemic happened, there were lots of traditional companies who didn&#8217;t think that they would be doing remote work as much in the near future as they had to,&#8221; Sharma said. &#8220;For them, things changed and then what they realized is that they did not have effective means of formal employee communication and also lacked the digital employee experience &#8212; and they realized that very quickly.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Simpplr is obviously not the only intranet solution on the market, but Sharma argues that the service isn&#8217;t just recognized by analyst firms like Gartner and Forrester, but also highly reviewed by its customers, in large parts thanks to its focus on user experience. &#8220;UX is our number one strength and differentiator. We have been pushing the boundaries of intranet for last five years,&#8221; he said and cited features like the company&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.simpplr.com\/auto-governance-engine\/\">auto-governance engine<\/a>, which he likened to a &#8220;Roomba for your intranet.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2177270\" style=\"width: 730px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-intranet-1x-1.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2177270\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2177270\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-intranet-1x-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"391\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-intranet-1x-1.png 720w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-intranet-1x-1.png?resize=150,81 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-intranet-1x-1.png?resize=300,163 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-intranet-1x-1.png?resize=680,369 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-intranet-1x-1.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2177270\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Simpplr<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Analytics, too, is another area where Simpplr is trying to differentiate itself. &#8220;Our company&#8217;s mission is to help companies build a better workplace &#8212; and unless we can show the areas of improvement and provide insights like how to do something better, we just become a dumb tool,\u201d he said. \u201cFor us, what is very important is not only that you are communicating but helping our customers to understand what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not working. What&#8217;s the impact of the communication and how are your employees feeling about it?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Looking ahead, the company is working on building more AI into its tools &#8211; including its analytics &#8212; to help companies better communicate with their employees and understand the impact of those messages.<\/p>\n<p>As for the new funding round, Sharma noted that he bootstrapped his previous two companies, which has made him take a somewhat conservative approach to fundraising. &#8220;When I used to hear that your investors or VCs expect growth at all costs, I just could never understand that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So while building this company, even though this is a venture-funded company, I still wanted to make sure that I use the finances responsibly and I build a business in a sustainable manner. I wanted to make sure that if we raised a large investment, we have a proper use for that investment and that this investment will bring the right results.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Tola Capital principal Eddie Kang will now join Simpplr&#8217;s board. &#8220;The future of work is hybrid and Simpplr is essential to a company&#8217;s ability to engage with employees,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As enterprise software investors, what excites us about Simpplr\u2019s platform is that it allows leadership teams to streamline communications across channels and provides a turnkey platform that drives value to customers very quickly. Our partnership with Simpplr will accelerate its roadmap to meet the needs of global business leaders and communications teams.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Simpplr, a modern platform for building intranet sites (or &#8217;employee communications and enablement platforms,&#8217; as the company calls it), today announced that it has raised a $32 million Series C round led by Tola Capital.

welcome back to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/equity\/id1215439780\">Equity<\/a>, TechCrunch\u2019s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.<\/p>\n<p>For this week\u2019s deep dive,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/alex\">Alex<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nmasc_\">Natasha<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DannyCrichton\">Danny<\/a> decided it was time to chat about funding rounds. Yep, everyone&#8217;s favorite topic, just in time for the return of our wonderful producer <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CGates123\">Chris.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>To help us navigate these particular waters, we had our friend and friendly competitor <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/alexrkonrad\">Alex Konrad<\/a> on the show. Konrad is a senior editor over at Forbes, and part of the founding duo behind the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/newsletter\/midastouch\/\">Midas Touch newsletter.<\/a> We like him &#8211; and his puppy!<\/p>\n<p>With four of us around the Zoom table, here&#8217;s what we got into:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>An overview of the venture capital market in Q2. You can read <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/09\/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good\/\">TechCrunch&#8217;s coverage of the global numbers here<\/a>, and our further exploration of the US market here. TechCrunch has more coming on the matter, so stay tuned.<\/li>\n<li>While the show includes the staggering statistics on the current funding frenzy, we soon broadened the conversation to why it all matters.<\/li>\n<li>Consider this a peek into the reporter&#8217;s notebook! We spoke about the supply and demand for covering funding rounds, the imbalance in who receives what money, and how an overall reader ad writer numbness to that $2 million pre-seed impacts the headlines.<\/li>\n<li>Which landed us into our final section: how to stand out in the overall deluge of funding rounds. Here we all had a take, because all reporters find different things interesting. Here we answer questions about what metrics to pay attention to, how to be more than a number in your pitch, and the value of talking about topics other than your startup&#8217;s success.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Thanks again to Alex K. for joining the show! Find him on Twitter,https:\/\/twitter.com\/alexrkonrad and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/alexkonrad\/\">check out his work at Forbes.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Chat with everyone on Friday, a show that is already coming together to be a scorcher.

raises $14.44M Series A to turn existing restaurants into cloud kitchens"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/acelerate.io\/\">Acelerate<\/a>, a software company looking to help restaurants make the most out of their infrastructure, is today announcing the close of a $14.44 million Series A financing led by Sequoia Capital.<\/p>\n<p>The startup was founded by George Jacobs, who grew up working in his family&#8217;s pizzeria. He attended USC with a plan to get a business degree and ultimately expand Georgee&#8217;s Pizza, but realized that there was an opportunity beyond his own family restaurant to help all kinds of restaurants in the wake of the tech boom.<\/p>\n<p>After a couple of years at Doordash, he came up with the idea for Acelerate, a startup working\u00a0to give restaurants a way to make the most of their infrastructure.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The first piece of the business is a simple software solution that allows restaurants to manage their entire digital footprint, from order management, pricing, menu updates and changes, to sales and marketing. The idea is that many restaurants are selling through their own brick-and-mortar location, of course, but also selling through a bevy of other platforms like Doordash, Uber Eats, or Seamless. On top of that, their restaurants are listed on Opentable, Yelp, and other marketing platforms.<\/p>\n<p>It can be a lot to manage.<\/p>\n<p>Acelerate&#8217;s SaaS product allows restaurants to manage all of these platforms from a single spot.<\/p>\n<p>But where the company really differentiates from rival players is its licensing business. Acelerate has developed seven proprietary restaurant brands, all with their own menus. They license those brands, complete with the recipes, cooking instructions, and a training guide to restaurants who want to offer more through their online sales portals.<\/p>\n<p>For example, an ice cream shop working with Acelerate may have a strong business in the summer, but struggle in the winter. That same ice cream shop may have a full working kitchen that rarely gets used save for what it takes to make ice cream and cones.<\/p>\n<p>Acelerate allows that shop to license the rights to operate a burger shop or a BBQ joint out of that same space, teaching employees how to make a bacon cheeseburger or a rack of ribs, thus creating an additional revenue stream for that restaurant during leaner months for its traditional business.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-2177394\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/IMG_1142.jpeg?w=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/IMG_1142.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/IMG_1142.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/IMG_1142.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/IMG_1142.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/IMG_1142.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/>Moreover, Acelerate not only licenses its own brands, but works with existing restaurant brands to license out their menus to other restaurant partners.<\/p>\n<p>Thus far, Acelerate has signed on three existing restaurants as brand licensing partners.<\/p>\n<p>Big chains, like Applebees, only use the software piece of Acelerate, but smaller restaurants gravitate toward the licensing product as a way to expand their business, it said. As cloud kitchens trend upward, the startup has found a way to turn existing restaurants into cloud kitchens, as well.<\/p>\n<p>The software side of the business operates as expected, on a monthly subscription model. On the licensing side, restaurants can license one of the brands offered through Acelerate, either homegrown or third-party. Acelerate collects a 40 percent fee from restaurant partners, which includes all third-party marketplace, order processing and delivery fees, as well as promotional spend. The startup also negotiates national food distribution deals to help restaurants get up and running with a new ingredient list.<\/p>\n<p>Jacobs told TechCrunch that Acelerate is currently working with thousands of restaurants on the software side, and that hundreds of stores are licensing the Acelerate brands.<\/p>\n<p>The startup&#8217;s new capital will be used towards further growth of the team and product. Right now, Acelerate has 11 full time employees, and about half of them are women or underrepresented minorities, according to Jacobs.<\/p>\n<p>Jacobs explained that the unique opportunity for the company is that it&#8217;s not purely a software play that sits on top of an already complicated tech stack.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The big opportunity lies in the combination of two great pieces of operating a restaurant, which is technology and operations,&#8221; said Jacobs. &#8220;To do that, we believe that proximity is power and we need to be as close to our customers as possible. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re really doubling down on building local teams and ensuring that we&#8217;re hands on with our operator and restaurant partners.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Acelerate, a software company looking to help restaurants make the most out of their infrastructure, is today announcing the close of a $14.44 million Series A financing led by Sequoia Capital.

Their patented deep technology is cleaner, faster and 4x more profitable than current lithium-ion battery recycling and the only technology to fully rejuvenate the battery cathode. For two decades lithium-ion batteries have been our preferred source of portable energy, but the sad reality is that with a lifespan of only 1 \u2013 3 years, 95% end up as dangerous landfill. The precious metals used to manufacture them are often mined in socially and environmentally damaging ways. They are not being recycled, because it is simply not economical to do so with current technology. Green Li-ion changes this by removing inefficient processes and improving the purity of the output, making lithium-ion battery rejuvenation and reuse the new reality. Green Li-ion\u2019s multi-cathode technology and control unit GLMC-1 enhances current lithium-ion battery recycling lines to produce 99.9% pure cathodes. This in turn delivers 4x profits for e-recyclers and lithium-ion battery recyclers, while halving production time. It\u2019s also currently the only technology in the world that can handle all major lithium-ion batteries at one time; which means no sorting.
